<p align="center">This is an template to make a source bin like site. By yourself.</p>

-------------------

## This is v1. We made CodeBoard (also known as SimplyBin) open-source. But this is a template so you can make your own !

--------------------

Fun Fact:
- We came up with the word **Binnium** Because _Chromium_ powers Chrome.
- **Binnium** (This template) powers the bin we made.

------------------

# Instructions

(This template does not come with a front end elements like Html/CSS)

- Create a .env file just like .env.example and delete the .env.example
- Get your mongoURI from [here](https://mongodb.com) and paste in the .env file
- Run the project. Here we go.
- If you need the site to be colorful, edit your site/`anyfile`.ejs and site/css/style.css
